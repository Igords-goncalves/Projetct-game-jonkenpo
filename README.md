We here some GIFS of the program working, they are [here](arquivo no drive).

## The Project

The idea of the program is:

_"I wanna improve my skills in Programming logic and Algorithms, using Portugol as a language"._

The game JoKenPo was an excercise suggested by the course [Algoritmos](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/course/curso-de-algoritmo/) in a educational plataform, the excercise is a part of a exercise list and has been sugested the following question: 

*31) DESAFIO - Crie um jogo de JoKenPo (Pedra-Papel-Tesoura)*!

From that chalenge I've started thinking and give form to my program.

**If you want study like me visit the plataform Curso em Video** üëç: [Curso em Video](https://www.cursoemvideo.com/) it's free plataform of technology curses (pt-BR üáßüá∑).

**The course "Algorithms" also is in Youtube, you can take a look** [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHz_AreHm4dmSj0MHol_aoNYCSGFqvfXV) 

**PS:** Portugol is a pseudolanguage that allows the reader to develop structured algorithms in Portuguese in a relatively simpler and more intuitive way, regardless of true programming language. The technique of successive refinements is used. After the final refinement, the algorithm is encoded in some language. The implementation of algorithms developed in Portuguese is easily done from a mapping to the desired programming language. It has existed since the 1970s, being used for learning programming languages.

Take a look in more informations about "Portugol" [here](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portugol)

## Why?

This program is part of my journey studing algorithms, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!

Also, you can use this Program as you wish, be for study or be for make improvements!

Please, fell free!

## Some Observations about this program

1 - There's no functionality extras, like a interface or front-end, it's just to pratice algorithms.

2 - The only option that works is the choice of options when the program ask you what it should do.

## Using the program

If you want to test the program you'll need a specialy compiler Portugol, you can do it on the web site below:

[Portugol.webstudio](https://portugol-webstudio.cubos.io/ide)

Get the code [here](https://github.com/Igords-goncalves/game_JOKENPO/blob/Functionalities/game_JOKENPO.por) and enoy it!

There is a possibility to covert the Code in a true language of programming, but it's comming soon!
